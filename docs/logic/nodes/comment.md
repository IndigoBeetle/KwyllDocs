## Description

![Comment Node](../../assets/nodes/comment.png){align=left width="25%"}
The *Comment Node* is a non-operational node, it doesn't connect to any flow or
have any input or output ports or parameters. It has a single multi-line text
field that you can enter any text into. The text will be saved with the game
data, but typically has no bearing on the exported data. This node is usually
used to provide some useful information in more complex logic graphs, a
description of the operation of a certain part of the graph, or instructions on
how to use a subgraph etc.

It is resizable and will retain its size, allowing you to place it and size it
to your requirements.
