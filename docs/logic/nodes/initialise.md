## Description

![Initialise Node](../../assets/nodes/initialise_node.png){align=left} The
*Initialise Node* is a specific type of *Node* called a __Trigger__. A trigger
*Node* is an entrypoint into a flow in the Kwyll logic. The *Initialise*
trigger will run the flow that follows on from it's __Flow Out__ port only once
at the start of the game.

## Ports

Flow Out
: As with all trigger nodes, an *Initialse Node* has only a single flow port
  on the output side. There is no input flow to a trigger node as it is
  the origin of a flow.
