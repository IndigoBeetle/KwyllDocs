# Move Object

## Description

![Move Object Node](../../assets/nodes/move_object.png){align=left width="25%"}
The *Move Object Node* takes input values X and Y that specify a position 
to move the specified object to. 

When moving an object using this node, if the object has the *Collide Bg*
[flag](../../object_flags.md) enabled, the node will check if the movement
results in a collision with the background tilemap and prevent it, resulting
in a different endpoint to the requested one. If the object has the
*Intersect Objects* [flag](../../object_flags.md) enabled, the node will check
if the final position results in it intersecting any other objects that have
the same flag enabled. Any such intersections will result in the
[Object Hit](./object_hit.md) flows on both objects being executed immediately.

The X and Y coordinates are in the coordinate system that is appropriate for the
object being moved. If the object is a room object, it expects the position to
be in room coordinates, if it is a map object, it expects it to be in map 
coordinates.

## Ports

Flow In
: In order for this node to perform its operation, it must be connected into an
  active flow using this input port. The flow will ultimately originate at a
  __Trigger__ node but can come from the __Flow Out__ port of any other flow
  node.

Flow Out
: A node connected to the __Flow Out__ port will be executed in sequence
  following the completion of this node's operation.

Ref 
: An object reference port that provides a reference to the object to check.
  If this is not connected, and the logic is on an object, the current object will be
  used.

X 
: An integer input port used to provide the X value of the new position.

Y 
: An integer input port used to provide the Y value of the new positio.


-------

## Parameters

X 
: A constant integer value for the X coordinate, used when the __X__ port is not
  connected.

Y 
: A constant integer value for the Y coordinate, used when the __Y__ port is not
  connected.
