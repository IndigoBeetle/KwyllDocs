## Description

brush at the specified index into that location.

## Ports

Flow In
: In order for this node to perform its operation, it must be connected into an
  active flow using this input port. The flow will ultimately originate at a
  __Trigger__ node but can come from the __Flow Out__ port of any other flow
  node.

Flow Out
: A node connected to the __Flow Out__ port will be executed in sequence
  following the completion of this node's operation.

X 
: An integer input port used to provide the X value of the tilemap coordinate.

Y 
: An integer input port used to provide the Y value of the tilemap coordinate.

Brush
: An integer input port used to specify the index of the brush to paste at the 
  given position.

## Parameters

X 
: A constant integer value for the X coordinate, used when the __X__ port is not
  connected.

Y 
: A constant integer value for the Y coordinate, used when the __Y__ port is not
  connected.

Brush 
: A constant integer value for the brush index, used when the __Brush__ port is not
  connected.
