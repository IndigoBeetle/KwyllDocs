# Room Exited

## Description

![Room Exited Node](../../assets/nodes/room_exited_trigger.png){align=left width="25%"}
The *Room Exited Node* is a specific type of *Node* called a __Trigger__. A
trigger *Node* is an entrypoint into a flow in the Kwyll logic. The *Room
Entered* trigger will run the flow that follows on from it's __Flow Out__ port
upon exiting a [location](../../introduction/terminology.md#locations) that
uses the room definition that this logic flow is defined on.

## Ports

Flow Out
: As with all trigger nodes, an *Room Entered Node* has only a single flow port
  on the output side. There is no input flow to a trigger node as it is
  the origin of a flow.
